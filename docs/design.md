# Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Exchange Student Message Board**

Project Author: **Jonty Doorman**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem
 
Exchange students can often feel overwhelmed by culture shock and other problems that come from living in a foreign country for the first time and can struggle to find an outlet to ask about the problems they're going through.
 
### End-User Requirements
 
Exchange students are students who go and study abroad to another school for any amount of time. Exchange students must be aged 14-18 and enrolled in year 9-13 or the overseas equivalent. They will all typically have a laptop on their exchange but will also want to use the website on their mobile device. Their IT experience can vary drastically so the system will have to be intuitive and easy to use.
 
### Proposed Solution
 
A website that acts as a message board for students to ask questions that are visible to anyone using the website and a reply function that allows anyone using the website to reply to their questions
 
End-users should be able to:
- register/login to an account
- upload questions to the message board
- reply to questions on the message board
- a searching system to find previously asked questions

## Relevant Implications
    Usability
    Cultural
    Functionality

Replace this text with a clear explanation of what the implication means.

Replace this text with an explanation of why the implication is relevant to this particular project.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

### Usability

The usability implications for websites refers to how easy the website is to use without the need for a tutorial or outside help.

The usability implication is relevant because exchange students can come from a variety of different backgrounds where they may or may not have had as much access to technology as other people therefore the website following a basic, common structure will make it much more accessable to a wider range of end-users.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

### Cultural

The cultural implications for websites refer to keeping a websites content and design unoffensive to different cultures.

End-users typically being exchange students means that they will come from a wide variety of different backgrounds. This means that the design and content of the website will have to avoid being culturally insensitive.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
